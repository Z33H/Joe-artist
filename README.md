# Joe-artist

Using the new Shopify 2.0 Dawn theme.

The only bespoke section is the Music section (section > music.liquid). I am getting a specific playlist from the API of Spotify, Then I am displaying the first three tracks from the playlist. When DOM interacted and one hovers over the image, the track plays the preview url.
